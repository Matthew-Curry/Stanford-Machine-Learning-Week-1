# Stanford-Machine-Learning-Week-1
This is my solution to the week 1 programming assignment for the CS 229 course on machine learning offered through Coursera. This assignment involved implementing linear regression through the gradient descent algorithm. To complete this assignment, I altered the warmUpExercise.m, plotData.m, gradientDescent.m, computeCost.m, gradientDescentMulti.m, computeCostMulti.m, featureNormalize.m, and normalEqn.m files
